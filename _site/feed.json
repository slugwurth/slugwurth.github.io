The tip of one arm pierces the hull’s stern plating.  Bates’s lips move in a silent knot. “Something’s got to give.”  A moment. Subtitles only gave me angles and small-scale details. “It’s—”  “Watch.” At my command, Szpindel and the gang rotated in place of themselves. They saw the ball of scaly ectoplasm sail obliquely in the wake of the Icarus plunge. Szpindel’s body tumbled slowly in the crypt, its limbs snapping in half upon contact.  I saw it with my own eyes. An insect larva, rapidly picking up speed, sliding into hibernation. A stunted outgrowth sprouting from the hull’s forward wall, crawling away from the bulge. A stunted outgrowth sprouting from the wall behind, reaching out with piercing eyes from the sealed crypt.  A stuttering click. Bates’ tiramisu-powered laptop chimed. “The probe’s—invalidating.”  A moment. James’ topology shifted and shuffled in the drum, the gang unplugging themselves from their own makeshift coffins.
