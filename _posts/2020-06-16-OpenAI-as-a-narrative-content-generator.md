title: OpenAI as a narrative content generator

I've been using something called GPT-2 (General Predictive Text 2) to generate text entries that I share with my party. GPT-2, developed and published by OpenAI, is a natural language model that "predicts" the words and sentences that would follow a user prompt. I've trained a simplified version of the model on sci-fi and horror novels found at the Project Gutenberg website. 

I developed this material to support a campaign based in APOF where I'm using a modified Prospero's Dream and the ACMD outbreak. I pass the word "Caliban" to my GPT-2 model as a prompt to generate a block of text. By controlling a "temperature" parameter in the language model, I can guide the level of percieved insanity of the text's author

> Tepid			https://txt.fyi/+/662ca8a9/
> Weird			https://txt.fyi/+/5e4fcd3e/	
> Incoherent	https://txt.fyi/+/fdfd31b7/

while keeping it contextually bound. I have a set of pregens sampled from this spectrum of insanity that I share with players as they examine terminal logs, journals in crew quarters, etc. to fit a descent-into-madness narrative component in my campaign. This, together with timely usage of OAI's Jukebox during play sessions, has added a degree of ..authenticity, if you will, to our gameplay experience. I hope it proves a worthy addition to your narrative toolboxes.

In a similar vein to GPT-2, OAI's Jukebox is a generative model that makes music *with lyrics.* The songs can be haunting by implication and hilarious by content: 'Classic Pop, in the style of Frank Sinatra' better known as "Hot Tub Time" is a must-listen. I've included a link below to one of the guides that helped me get everything set up. The process takes some diligence in file naming and tracking but almost all of the heavy lifting has already been done.

I've posted this material in #wardens because I see the AI authorship *reveal to the players* as a possible tool that you may want to use, and so hopefully usefulness has been maximized. If any of this brings any excellent moments to your groups I'd love to hear about them.

cheers,

> Endnote: OpenAI *purposefully* released only a simplified version of the GPT-2 model that researchers developed due to the misinformation catalyzing potential. GPT-2 is *very good* at generating text that feels like it was written by a human, and they just released GPT-3 this year. :thinking: The sci-fi horror is not always so distant, it seems.
